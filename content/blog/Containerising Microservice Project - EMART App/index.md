Hello and Happy New Year!! I know we are 2 weeks into the year but if I'm being honest, I still have my Christmas decorations up so I'm still in the new year mood. In this blog, we are going to cover containers.... Yup! I know what you are thinking. The title is not different from what we're going to talk about. The blog will cover how to package a microservice app into a docker container for easy deployment. Now what is a microservice? I'm sure you might have an idea of what it is but if you don't, here is how I summarize what it is. Microservices is an architectural style that divides an application into a number of services that can be deployed separately, are loosely coupled, highly maintainable and testable. Large, sophisticated applications may be delivered quickly, often, and reliably thanks to the microservice design. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
