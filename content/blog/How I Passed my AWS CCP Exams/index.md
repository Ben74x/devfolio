description: 'How I passed the AWS CCP Exams'
---

As someone who has been a cloud fanatic since 2020, one of my best highlights last month was passing the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner exams. The journey from studying to taking the exam was incredible and I am proud of myself for persevering. The journey started last month at my university. I had the chance to join a free AWS summer class which was hosted by <a href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/gotenggokop.html">Dr. Gokop Goteng</a>. It was a two week course and the most important thing to mention is that, the course demonstrated a foundational understanding of Cloud principles, AWS Services, and other aspects of the Infrastructure as a Service platform that AWS offers, including billing, pricing, and security. It was designed for students to take on the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner Exams.

My preparation for the exam was a little intense because I did not trust myself to go for the exams after taking the course for 2 weeks. In addition to that, there was a two price package for the course which I wanted to win so I really put in the extra work. The price packages were:
- City University of London AWS Best Scholar: This award was given to the student who got the highest mark in the practice exams after the two week course.

- City University of London AWS Most Engaged Student: This award was given to the student who contributed a lot in class, completed all the lab exercises first and scored a good mark in the practice exams.
