Hello, Ola, Ciao, Bonjour, Hallo. Well well let's just say I was getting bored of using the same introduction in my blogs so I wanted to switch up a little :). In this blog we are going to utilize some of the AI/ML services in AWS. We are going to build a serveless website that uses image recognition and a chatbot system. AWS has services that can be used to create these with ease instead of taking time to train these ML models from scratch...Amazing right?
I'm going to assume you know how to host static websites on S3. If you don't know how to do that, I have a blog on it and you can check it out. To do this project, you are not expected to have any background knowledge in the AI?ML services. Having a general understanding of Javascript will be perfect for the project. Now let's focus on the AI/ML services. AWS has services that support the developments of chatbot and image recognition systems. These services are **Amazon Lex** and **Amazon Rekognition**

Amazon Lex is a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces in applications.![product-page-diagram_Amazon-Lex 4227debf7110b1f16add010b55be881aa37fbd7b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37503046/194777633-ea63dcd9-a879-42bf-a8ce-31298912d80b.png)

It has the following use cases:
- **Build virtual agents and voice assistants**: Enable self-service capabilities with virtual contact center agents and interactive voice response (IVR). Users can change a password or schedule an appointment without speaking to a human agent.
- **Automate informational responses**: Design conversational solutions that provide responses to frequently asked questions. Improve Connect & Lex conversation flows for tech support, HR benefits, or finance with natural language search for FAQs powered by Amazon Kendra.
- **Improve productivity with application bots**: Automate basic user tasks in your application with powerful chatbots. Seamlessly connect with other enterprise software through AWS Lambda and maintain granular access control through IAM.
- **Maximize the information trapped in transcripts**: Design chatbots using existing contact center transcripts. Reduce design time from weeks to hours and accelerate bot deployment.
