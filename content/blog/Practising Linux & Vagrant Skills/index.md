In this blog, I'll talk about how one can use Linux and Vagrant to setup a website on a virtual machine. One does not need to be an expert in Linux or Vagrant to be able to implement this project. Having a basic knowledge in both skill set should be fine. We will be setting up a website on a virtual machine with centos7. Before we do that, we need to install a virtual machine and vagrant on our Linux based system. The rest of the requirements will be talked mentioned later on in the blog.
