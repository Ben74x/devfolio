In the previous blog, we set up a website on a centos7 VM. All of it was done manually and I mentioned in the previous blog that we will automate the whole process from start to finish using Vagrant Provisioning. We are going to put all the commands and steps in Vagrant provisioning section. This is known as Infrastracture as a code.
